Guidelines for pushing to this repo:

1) Quality commits
- Message 
"[Label (Bugfix, Feature, Hotfix, Doc.)]: 1 line overview, unique
 * Detail 1
 * Detail 2
 * (Max 4 details)"
- Code includes light documentation around methods, class def's, helper fn's

2) Appropriate branch
- We will follow a "feature branch" development style. "master" branch is sacred
 and protected, so the only way to "merge" code is by pushing code to another
 "feature" branch off latest version of "master". 

3) Especially important for feature code: create a pull-request 
* PR should include design document in description (best if written out before 
any coding has been done)
* Code review (>1 "+1's" from subsystem leads/peers, mentor will merge) and discussion
